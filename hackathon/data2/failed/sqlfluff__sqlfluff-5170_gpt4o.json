"}, {"role": "user", "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[EXPERIMENT]: Rethink Matching routines\nThis is another experiment, and also a biggie. It's a rethink of matching as part of #5124.\r\n\r\nThis will need some tidying to get it into a state that it's reviewable, but given the scale of it - I think I shouldn't take it much further without getting some of it merged.\r\n\r\nIt's mostly additions for now, so I now need to strip out the things that we can get rid of as a result. Opening PR for testing and in particular for coverage.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sqlfluff__sqlfluff)\nbash-$"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DISCUSSION\nFirst, let's list the files in the current directory to get an overview of the project structure.

This will give us insight into how matching is performed and how it might be rethought or improved.\n\nLet's scroll down to see the rest of the `_match_once` method and any other relevant methods in this class.\n\n"}, {"action": "scroll_down\n", "observation": "[File: /sqlfluff__sqlfluff/src/sqlfluff/core/parser/grammar/anyof.py (276 lines total)]\n(176 more lines above)\n177:                unmatched_segments = match.unmatched_segments\n178:                n_matches += 1\n179:            else:\n180:                # If we get here, then we've not managed to match.

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's first start by reproducing the results of the issue. The issue includes some example code for reproduction, which we can use. We'll create a new file called `reproduce.py` and paste the example code into it.\n```\ncreate reproduce.py\n```\n[File: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py (1 lines total)]\n1:\n\n(Open file: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nNow let's paste in the example code from the issue.\n```\nedit 1:1\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\nend_of_edit\n```\n[File: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py (9 lines total)]\n1:from marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\n2:from datetime import timedelta\n3:\n4:td_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n5:\n6:obj = dict()\n7:obj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n8:\n9:print(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\nFile updated.

The current implementation uses integer division, which truncates the decimal part and can lead to incorrect rounding on line 1475.To fix this issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round the result to the nearest integer before converting it to an int.

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[EXPERIMENT]: Rethink Matching routines\nThis is another experiment, and also a biggie. It's a rethink of matching as part of #5124.\r\n\r\nThis will need some tidying to get it into a state that it's reviewable, but given the scale of it - I think I shouldn't take it much further without getting some of it merged.\r\n\r\nIt's mostly additions for now, so I now need to strip out the things that we can get rid of as a result. Opening PR for testing and in particular for coverage.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sqlfluff__sqlfluff)\nbash-$", "agent": "primary"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DISCUSSION\nFirst, let's list the files in the current directory to get an overview of the project structure.

This will give us insight into how matching is performed and how it might be rethought or improved.\n\nLet's scroll down to see the rest of the `_match_once` method and any other relevant methods in this class.\n\n", "action": "scroll_down\n", "agent": "primary"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[File: /sqlfluff__sqlfluff/src/sqlfluff/core/parser/grammar/anyof.py (276 lines total)]\n(98 more lines above)\n99:                trim_noncode=False,\n100:            )\n101:\n102:        return match, matched_option\n103:\n104:    @match_wrapper()\n105:    @allow_ephemeral\n106:    def match(\n107:        self, segments: Tuple[BaseSegment, ...], parse_context: ParseContext\n108:    ) -> MatchResult:\n109:        \"\"\"Match against any of the elements a relevant number of times.\n110:\n111:        If it matches multiple, it returns the longest, and if any are the same\n112:        length it returns the first (unless we explicitly just match first).\n113:        \"\"\"\n114:        # First if we have an *exclude* option, we should check that\n115:        # which would prevent the rest of this grammar from matching.\n116:        if self.exclude:\n117:            with parse_context.deeper_match(\n118:                name=self.__class__.__name__ + \"-Exclude\"\n119:            ) as ctx:\n120:                if self.exclude.match(segments, ctx):\n121:                    return MatchResult.from_unmatched(segments)\n122:\n123:        # Match on each of the options\n124:        matched_segments: MatchResult = MatchResult.from_empty()\n125:        unmatched_segments: Tuple[BaseSegment, ...] = segments\n126:        n_matches = 0\n127:\n128:        # Keep track of the number of times each option has been matched.\n129:        option_counter = {elem.cache_key(): 0 for elem in self._elements}\n130:\n131:        while True:\n132:            if self.max_times and n_matches >= self.max_times:\n133:                # We've matched as many times as we can\n134:                return MatchResult(\n135:                    matched_segments.matched_segments, unmatched_segments\n136:                )\n137:\n138:            # Is there anything left to match?\n139:            if len(unmatched_segments) == 0:\n140:                # No...\n141:                if n_matches >= self.min_times:\n142:                    return MatchResult(\n143:                        matched_segments.matched_segments, unmatched_segments\n144:                    )\n145:                else:  # pragma: no cover TODO?\n146:                    # We didn't meet the hurdle\n147:                    return MatchResult.from_unmatched(unmatched_segments)\n148:\n149:            # If we've already matched once...\n150:            if n_matches > 0 and self.allow_gaps:\n151:                # Consume any non-code if there is any\n152:                pre_seg, mid_seg, post_seg = trim_non_code_segments(unmatched_segments)\n153:                unmatched_segments = mid_seg + post_seg\n154:            else:\n155:                pre_seg = ()  # empty tuple\n156:\n157:            match, matched_option = self._match_once(\n158:                unmatched_segments, parse_context=parse_context\n159:            )\n160:\n161:            # Increment counter for matched option.\n162:            if matched_option:\n163:                matched_key = matched_option.cache_key()\n164:                if matched_option.cache_key() in option_counter:\n165:                    option_counter[matched_key] += 1\n166:                    # Check if we have matched an option too many times.\n167:                    if (\n168:                        self.max_times_per_element\n169:                        and option_counter[matched_key] > self.max_times_per_element\n170:                    ):\n171:                        return MatchResult(\n172:                            matched_segments.matched_segments, unmatched_segments\n173:                        )\n174:\n175:            if match:\n176:                matched_segments += pre_seg + match.matched_segments\n177:                unmatched_segments = match.unmatched_segments\n178:                n_matches += 1\n179:            else:\n180:                # If we get here, then we've not managed to match.
