Here\'s the issue text:\nISSUE:\nDataset.to_json_dict can still generate exceptions when suppress_invalid_tags=True\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI\'m using `Dataset.to_json_dict(suppress_invalid_tags=True)` and can live with losing invalid tags.  Unfortunately, I can still trigger an exception with something like  `2.0` in an `IS` field.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nto_json_dict shouldn\'t throw an error about an invalid tag when `suppress_invalid_tags` is enabled.\r\n\r\nMy thought was simply to move the `data_element = self[key]` into the try/catch block that\'s right after it.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nTraceback:\r\n```\r\n  File "dicom.py", line 143, in create_dict\r\n    json_ds = ds.to_json_dict(suppress_invalid_tags=True)\r\n  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pydicom/dataset.py", line 2495, in to_json_dict\r\n    data_element = self[key]\r\n  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pydicom/dataset.py", line 939, in __getitem__\r\n    self[tag] = DataElement_from_raw(elem, character_set, self)\r\n  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pydicom/dataelem.py", line 859, in DataElement_from_raw\r\n    value = convert_value(vr, raw, encoding)\r\n  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pydicom/values.py", line 771, in convert_value\r\n    return converter(byte_string, is_little_endian, num_format)\r\n  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pydicom/values.py", line 348, in convert_IS_string\r\n    return MultiString(num_string, valtype=pydicom.valuerep.IS)\r\n  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pydicom/valuerep.py", line 1213, in MultiString\r\n    return valtype(splitup[0])\r\n  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pydicom/valuerep.py", line 1131, in __new__\r\n    raise TypeError("Could not convert value to integer without loss")\r\nTypeError: Could not convert value to integer without loss\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your environment**\r\npython 3.7, pydicom 2.3\r\n\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you\'re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you\'re in the repository\'s root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you\'re satisfied with all of the changes you\'ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you\'ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn\'t work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It\'s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you\'d like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file "buggy-input.png" If that doesn\'t work, use the linux \'find\' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn\'t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pydicom__pydicom)\nbash-$'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'DISCUSSION\nTo start solving this issue, let\'s first try to reproduce the bug.

The problem occurs because the `data_element = self[key]` line is outside the try-except block. This means that if there\'s an error when accessing the element (which is what\'s happening with the IS element containing a float), the `suppress_invalid_tags` option doesn\'t have a chance to catch it.\n\nLet\'s modify the method to move the `data_element = self[key]` line inside the try-except block.
