Here\'s the issue text:\nISSUE:\nJinja: sqlfluff fails in the presence of assignments with multiple targets\n### Search before asking\r\n\r\n- [X] I searched the [issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) and found no similar issues.\r\n\r\nI did search, and I think this _may_ be related, but since no more information was provided I cannot confirm it: https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues/2947. For this reason, I opened a new issue.\r\n\r\n### What Happened\r\n\r\nJinja templates support multiple targets in [assignments](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#assignments). However, `sqlfluff` fails to lint a file in the presence of an assignment with multiple targets.\r\n\r\nI traced this back to the `update_inside_set_or_macro` function, specifically [this line](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/blob/main/src/sqlfluff/core/templaters/slicers/tracer.py#L244=).\r\n\r\nThe way `sqlfluff` is determining whether we are inside a [block assignment](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#block-assignments) is by checking for the presence of an equals in the second index of the trimmed parts of the current raw slice:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif len(filtered_trimmed_parts) < 3 or filtered_trimmed_parts[2] != "=":\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis condition is false for single target assignments:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n{% set a = 1 %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich produce the expected trimmed parts (with spaces removed as in [line 243](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/blob/main/src/sqlfluff/core/templaters/slicers/tracer.py#L243=)):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n[\'set\', \'a\', \'=\', \'1\']\r\n#             2    \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, with multiple targets:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n{% set a, b = 1, 2 %}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n[\'set\', \'a\', \',\', \'b\', \'=\', \'1\', \'2\']\r\n#                       4    \r\n```\r\n\r\nEquals is no longer in the index 2, but has been bumped to index 4, yet we are not in the expanded block form of set assignments. This causes the `inside_set_or_macro` flag to be incorrectly set to `True`, as if we were using a block assignment, which causes the entire template to be ignored (or something like that), and leads to the eventual `ValueError` raised.\r\n\r\nI played around a bit with potential solutions: first, I tried incrementing the index of the equals by the number of commas:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nequals_index = 2 + sum((c == \',\' for c in  filtered_trimmed_parts))\r\nif len(filtered_trimmed_parts) < 3 or filtered_trimmed_parts[equals_index] != "=":\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this would bring issues if using the expanded form of set assignments with any commas in it, or in the presence of an uneven number of commas on both sides of the assignment.\r\n\r\nAnother simpler option would be to check for the presence of a single equals:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif len(filtered_trimmed_parts) < 3 or filtered_trimmed_parts.count("=") != 1:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis one seems more promising, specially considering that multiple targets appear not to be supported with block assignments (at least, that\'s what I think, as the docs don\'t mention it, and trying it locally raises a too many values to unpack error). Thus, the first condition will always be true for block assignments (so, even the presence of an equals in the body of the assignment would not cause issues).\r\n\r\n### Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nsqlfluff should lint files properly, even in the presence of assignments with multiple targets.\r\n\r\n### Observed Behaviour\r\n\r\nLinting fails when an exception is raised:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10dbt/bin/sqlfluff", line 8, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(cli())\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/click/core.py", line 1128, in __call__\r\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/click/core.py", line 1053, in main\r\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/click/core.py", line 1659, in invoke\r\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/click/core.py", line 1395, in invoke\r\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/click/core.py", line 754, in invoke\r\n    return __callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py", line 541, in lint\r\n    result = lnt.lint_paths(\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/linter/linter.py", line 1098, in lint_paths\r\n    self.lint_path(\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/linter/linter.py", line 1050, in lint_path\r\n    for i, linted_file in enumerate(runner.run(fnames, fix), start=1):\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/linter/runner.py", line 101, in run\r\n    for fname, partial in self.iter_partials(fnames, fix=fix):\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/linter/runner.py", line 54, in iter_partials\r\n    for fname, rendered in self.iter_rendered(fnames):\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/linter/runner.py", line 43, in iter_rendered\r\n    yield fname, self.linter.render_file(fname, self.config)\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/linter/linter.py", line 771, in render_file\r\n    return self.render_string(raw_file, fname, config, encoding)\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/linter/linter.py", line 742, in render_string\r\n    templated_file, templater_violations = self.templater.process(\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/templaters/jinja.py", line 394, in process\r\n    TemplatedFile(\r\n  File "/home/tomasfarias/.pyenv/versions/3.10.2/envs/3.10dbt/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sqlfluff/core/templaters/base.py", line 94, in __init__\r\n    raise ValueError("Cannot instantiate a templated file unsliced!")\r\nValueError: Cannot instantiate a templated file unsliced!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Save the following template to `model.sql` in an empty directory:\r\n```sql\r\n{% set a, b = 1, 2 %}\r\n\r\nSELECT {{ a }}\r\n```\r\n2. Run `sqlfluff lint model.sql --dialect \'postgres\'`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dialect\r\n\r\nTried with postgres and redshift dialects, however I think others may be affected as long as they use jinja templates.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\nv0.12.0\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nNothing, ran from an empty directory.\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to work on and submit a PR to address the issue?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project\'s [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you\'re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you\'re in the repository\'s root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you\'re satisfied with all of the changes you\'ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you\'ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn\'t work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It\'s much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you\'d like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file "buggy-input.png" If that doesn\'t work, use the linux \'find\' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn\'t, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sqlfluff__sqlfluff)\nbash-$'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "DISCUSSION\nFirst, I'll create a file named `reproduce.sql` to replicate the issue using the provided SQL template.\n```\ncreate reproduce.sql\n```"}]}
