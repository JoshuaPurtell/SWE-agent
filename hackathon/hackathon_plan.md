Evals
- cleaner / more informative logging for individual runs
- ability to easily run a medium size (~10 runs) experiment

- Identify why context blows up beyond 8192 tok
- If we use L3.1, context less of an issue. But still valuable IME

Learning
- Can we FT L3.1-8/70b? May take some work getting unsloth setup
